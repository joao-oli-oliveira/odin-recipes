    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These cookies are like JavaScript; they're not just about sweetness but also about functionality. <br>
        Baking them requires a bit more skill, akin to coding in JavaScript, but the result is interactive and delightful, <br>
        just like a well-scripted website.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> - Softened for the base, like the <em>foundation</em> of your script.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> - Granulated and brown, for that sweet interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - Binding everything together, like <em>variables</em> in your code.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> - A touch of flavor, think of it as a <em>string</em> literal.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong> - All-purpose, the <em>structure</em> you can't do without.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda</strong> - For lift and spread, like <em>functions</em> that expand the outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - Just a pinch to enhance flavors, akin to <em>debugging</em> your code.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong> - Semi-sweet or dark, the <em>objects</em> you manipulate.</li>
        <li><strong>Coffee Beans or Coffee Powder</strong> - Finely ground or chopped, adding the Java aspect, like <em>events</em> in JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Add 2 large eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each, ensuring your code (or in this case, dough) runs smoothly.</li>
                <li>Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract for that flavor enhancement.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                <li>Gradually blend into the butter mixture, like gradually building your program.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add the Chips and Coffee</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of finely ground coffee beans or 2 tablespoons of coffee powder, giving your cookies that distinctive Java Chip taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare for Baking</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them like you would elements in a UI.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes until the edges are just turning golden, like watching a script execute to completion.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cool</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely, akin to finalizing your project.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
